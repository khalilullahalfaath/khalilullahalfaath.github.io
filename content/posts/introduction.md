Hi! This is me Khalil. Even though this isn't actually my first post in this website, I would like to say thanks to everyone who visits this website.

In this post, I want to tell a brief story how I managed to develop this website and my life after graduating.

## Background

My initial intention in developing this website was to share my thoughts and reviews. Not only that, I also wanted to practice my software engineering skills, which wasn't easy back then because I didn't fully embrace software engineering when I was in university :'(.

It all started around four months ago, I saw an X post from @aria_ghora, in which he posted about stuck loss when training a neural network. You can see that [here](https://ghora.net/notes/20240822-stuck-loss/). I really enjoyed reading that, and it inspired me to do so. The second person who inspired me to build this web was a fictional character from The Big Bang Theory named Sheldon Cooper. He also created a blog site in which he writes everything about him, from his bathroom schedules to his enemy lists. Surely I promise I wouldn't do the same :)

After convincing myself to build a web, I immediately browsed what tech stacks I could use, and my first thought was React. Why? Because I'd been studying it for 2 months since March 2024, so I didn't want to make all of my hard work useless. But after working on it for 2 days, I thought I couldn't do this. This library is too sophisticated, and I didn't want to waste my time just configuring it. Checked?‚ùå

Then I tried NextJS, the result was the same. I didn't believe that I would finish this web if I didn't know how to work it. Checked? ‚ùå

Finally, when I was searching for videos on YouTube, there was a video recommendation from Fireship. He suggested that I could try Hugo. There is also a brief tutorial, and it was very easy to read. Not only, do I love the simplicity, but also the pace that it needed to ship it. Checked? ‚úÖ


**What‚Äôs New: Now With CMS!**

Initially, this site was fully static‚Äîeverything had to be written in Markdown and committed manually. While that worked, it wasn‚Äôt very practical, especially when I wanted to write on the go or from different devices.


So I decided to integrate a CMS (Content Management System) into the site!

This is a big step for me because it combines functionality and ease‚Äîtwo things I really care about. Whether I‚Äôm using my phone, tablet, or laptop, I now have full control over my content.

(And don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs still all version-controlled behind the scenes üòâ)
