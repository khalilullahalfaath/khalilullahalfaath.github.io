Learning vocabs

Learning verb



Why did I move from Duolingo as my main source of Learning Platform

\- Duolingo is too slow

\- Duolingo’s Curriculum isn’t properly designed for Learning in a serious way

\- Duolingo Freemium is bullshit, too many ads, horrible energy system

\- Max energy before the update was 25 energy bars and it was horrible and unplayable, and after the update increases to 30 energy bars (still meh than the heart’s system, but yeah, what can I do)

\- The use of AI in Duolingo
