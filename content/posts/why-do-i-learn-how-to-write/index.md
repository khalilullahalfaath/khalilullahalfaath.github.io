description: "I had always considered myself a good writer since I was a kid. I
  enjoyed writing mini-articles on Facebook, keeping daily journals, and even
  debating online with long arguments! I thought moving from writing in Bahasa
  Indonesia to English would be seamless. But when I started preparing for the
  IELTS exam, especially learning how to write to meet its requirements, it was
  clear that I was not. "

I began my journey of learning how to write specifically for the IELTS writing section in 2024. At first, I thought that maybe I should start by focusing on grammar, as I had never truly understood it. Even the basics felt shaky once I tried to recall them -- Blame Indonesia's national curriculum for this :D For example, when it came to tenses, I only knew the simple present, present continuous, and simple past. Realising this was, frankly, embarrassing. 

The problem was, I did not know where to learn. I asked myself, "Should I use books, take an online course, watch YouTube tutorials, or something else?" While searching for recommendations online, I came across this book called ***English Grammar in Use***, which, apparently, has long been considered the best grammar book out there. It seemed like a good place to start, so I thought, why not give it a try?
