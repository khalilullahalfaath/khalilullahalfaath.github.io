description: "I had always considered myself a good writer since I was a kid. I
  enjoyed writing mini-articles on Facebook, writing my daily journals, or even
  debating with long arguments online! However, after studying for my IELTS
  preparation, specifically learning how to write to fulfil the IELTS
  requirements, it was clear that I was not. "
