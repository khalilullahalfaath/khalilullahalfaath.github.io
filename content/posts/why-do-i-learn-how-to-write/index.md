description: "I had always considered myself a good writer since I was a kid. I
  enjoyed writing mini-articles on Facebook, keeping daily journals, and even
  debating online with long arguments! I thought moving from writing in Bahasa
  Indonesia to English would be seamless. But when I started preparing for the
  IELTS exam, especially learning how to write to meet its requirements, it was
  clear that I was not. "
