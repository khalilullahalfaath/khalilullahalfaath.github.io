This long essay is mainly inspired by Marcus Aurelius Meditation. I am trying to make this essay more 

## Book 1

> This book records the virtues I have inherited from those who came before I am, from what I heard and told, those who I have lived beside, from what I experienced and learnt, and also those who I have never met, whose works nonetheless have shaped the person who I am.

From my mother: I learnt discipline, patience, and hard work; to have always put education first, and be grateful, whatever the result is, good or bad; She rarely displayed affection in the way others might expect. But in time, I understood that every sacrifice, every silent act, every order and yelling, was her way of saying *I care*.

From my best friend in high school: to always put my family first, and try hard for them, even if I have to move to new places; to bring laughter to my friends, but always with care, so my words don’t wound.

From my neighbor: I learnt how to be a heart of gold, a kind neighbor, and a faithful person; she was a woman of deep devotion, early to the mosque, kind to all, generous beyond measure; her final years wasn’t easy, she had to suffer with illness, yet she didn’t curse it. She bore it with patience, her faith unshaken. She never complaint, only quiet strength she shined;
