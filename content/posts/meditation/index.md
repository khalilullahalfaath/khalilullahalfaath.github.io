This long essay is mainly inspired by Marcus Aurelius’s Meditation. I am trying to make this essay more poetic, to challenge myself in writing in English.

I did not write this essay to be admired, nor to teach others how to live, but to remind myself. Of who I am, of who I must strive to be, and of the people whose virtues I hope to reflect.

## Book 1

> This book records the virtues I have inherited from those who came before I am, from what I heard and told, and those who I have lived beside, from what I experienced and learnt, and also those who I have never met, whose works nonetheless have shaped the person who I am.

From my mother: I learnt discipline, patience, and hard work; to have always put my education first, and be grateful, whatever the result is, good or bad; She rarely displayed affection in the way others might expect. But in time, I understood that every sacrifice, every silent act, every order and yelling, was her way of saying *I care*. 

Further, to always put my best in my works, my colleagues, and my family; to be responsible with my work, and not relying on others; to not procrastinate, and always come early; to avoid any wrongdoings, especially corruption, nepotism, selfishness, and greed, even in thought.

From my father: responsibility, love of family, and generosity; to always make contact, and always believe that “you reap what you sow”; He taught me to endure suffering in silence, but to remain kind; Though his years were few, everyone still remember his goodness; 

From my Bunda: social interactions, loyalty, and generosity. It is not important who I am helping but always trying to help whoever they are; to always help and care for my parents, and to be a devoted child.

From my sister: not to put loyalty to friends above loyalty to family. 

From my maternal grandmother: to lead with kindness, but always be prepared for the worst; to raise children with discipline, yet never withhold affection; to stay loyal, even long after a loved one is gone.

From my paternal grandmother: that death in the family is inevitable; to grieve silently, and always show my stronger self to my children; to always maintain good health by exercising and eating healthy food. 

From my aunts and uncles: to always treat others kindly and generously; to always attend family gatherings; to always help each other in the family;

From my professors at University: to be endlessly curious and reflect on everything; always look for answers differently, even though there are already different solutions; to always help my pupils, and not see them differently; 

From my closest friend from childhood: to keep trying, even when the door closes, another one will open, to trust myself, but not isolate myself from others; to always stand for myself, and to respect my need and condition.

From my best friend in high school: to always put my family first, and try hard for them, even if I have to move to new places; to bring laughter to my friends, but always with care, so my words don’t wound.

From my neighbor: I learnt how to be a heart of gold, a kind neighbor, and a faithful person; she was a woman of deep devotion, early to the mosque, kind to all, generous beyond measure; her final years wasn’t easy, she had to suffer with illness, yet she didn’t curse it. She bore it with patience, her faith unshaken. She never complained, only quiet strength she shined.

From Allah: that I have good grandparents, good parents, good family, good teachers, good relatives and friends, almost everyone; that I had a joyful childhood, with the privilege of experiencing my late father’s prime, and being loved by him deeply, and so by my grandmother; 

Furthermore, that I have been blessed with a balanced fortune, not in excess, nor in deprivation.
