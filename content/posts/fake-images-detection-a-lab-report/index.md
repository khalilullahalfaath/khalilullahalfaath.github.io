  As I want to continue practising my writing, and I'm currently doing a
  research collaboration, I asked myself, isn't this a great moment to write a
  report-like post? So welcome :D 

  In this long post, I am going to record my journey, my thought process, and my ups and downs while doing this project. I hope that those who read this post could gain some insights if they wanted to research this very same topic.

This fake image detection research is a collaborative effort between me and my online friend
