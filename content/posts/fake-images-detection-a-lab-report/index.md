  As I want to continue practising my writing, and I'm currently doing a
  research collaboration, I asked myself, isn't this a great moment to write a
  report-like post? So welcome :D 

  In this long post, I am going to record my journey, my thought process, and my ups and downs while doing this project. I hope that those who read this post could gain some insights if they wanted to research this very same topic.

This fake image detection research is a collaborative effort between me and my online friend, Panji. He approached me on July 29th, 2025, explaining that he wanted to collaborate on doing research in Computer Vision, particularly Fake Image detection. At that time, I initially wanted to refuse since I had never heard or read any papers about this topic, and I wanted to focus on preparing my materials for my master's. However, I thought that I should challenge myself wandering new topics especially if that topic is intersected with my interests.

As I agreed to pull this project together with him, I offered myself to create a spreadsheeet dashboard to monitor our progress and to store our literature review and our draft. Also, because I highly value the spirit to 'open-source' all of my projects, anyone who wants the template can ask me through [this e-mail](mailto:khalilullah.alfaath21@gmail.com?subject=Asking%20for%20the%20research%20project%20dashboard%20template&body=Hi%2C%20I%20am%20from%20your%20blog%20asking%20for%20the%20research%20dashboard%20template.%20Thank%20you).

From the picture, we can see that I order this spreadsheets based on the timeline of a project. There are at least
10 pages with a different function. Here are the details:

* README, for onboarding and file management.
* Meeting notes, to record my meeting topics, dates, discussions or decisions, PIC, status, deadline date, and additional notes.
* Timeline, it's more like a Gantt chart wannabe
