### About Me

Hi! Khalilullah Al Faath's here. What I mostly do is AI Engineering,  but sometimes I procrastinate in software engineering in general. I am interested in AI research and its applications in the real-world.
I'm especially interested in machine learning theory, evolutionary algorithms, NLP, and computer vision 😄. If you're interested in working with me, please find my email below.

### 💼 Experience
* Master's Student @Gadjah Mada University (2025 - now)
* Researcher and Engineer @Braincore (2024 - 2025)
* Software Engineer Intern @PT. Len  Industry (2023)
* Bachelor's Student, Lecturer, and Practicum Assistant @Telkom University (2022-2023)
