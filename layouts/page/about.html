    <h3>üìç About this website</h3>
    <p>
      This website is inspired by a fictional character named

      >
      and <a href="https://ghora.net">@Ghora</a>. It is created to share
      insights through blog posts, where I also share my learning experiences,
      schedules, reviews, and weekly journals from my real-world activities. The
      website is built using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
